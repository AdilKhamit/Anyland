# Anyland
 Anyland is a social virtual reality sandbox universe where everything is created with your own hands, right in the world!
 
 This smaller file selection from a much bigger project is especially focused on general use and data import/ export -- please note I'd do many things different with organization & source logic if I were to write it now, but hopefully it's of use to you!
